You have a meat processing facility. You process the animals from livestock, to carcasses ready for cutting into smaller pieces. 
Next week, you are getting this many animals which you need to process for cutting:

                       Mon  Tue   Wed  Thu  Fri
Animals to slaughter    120   70    20  100   80

You can slaughter as many animals you want per day, after which you'll get carcasses grouped into groups according to the below weight and frequency table (in kg):

Group       AVG   STDDEV        F
    g1      365   4.9       0.28571429
    g2      375   5.1       0.28571429
    g3      385   5.0       0.14285714
    g4      395   5.3       0.14285714
    g5      405   5.9       0.14285714

After slaughtering them every day, you prepare them for cutting. You can cut them the next day, at the earliest.
If you can cut a maximum of 30000 kg per day, on a First In First Out strategy, what will the schedule table for cutting these carcases look like for the next week?
